Mike's Number Guessing Game
---------------------------

Select one of three difficulties and guess the randomly generated number.
There are clues (greater/lower) to help narrow down the possible guesses.
After the number is guessed, you may choose to play again and select a new difficulty.
I used methods to keep the code clean, readable and reusable.
